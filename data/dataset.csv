Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.
This notebook goes over how to use a retriever that under the hood uses an SVM
using scikit-learn
package.
Largely based on https://github.com/karpathy/randomfun/blob/master/knn_vs_svm.html
%pip install --upgrade --quiet scikit-learn
%pip install --upgrade --quiet lark
We want to use OpenAIEmbeddings
so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.
import getpass
import os
if ""OPENAI_API_KEY"" not in os.environ:
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"")
OpenAI API Key: ········
from langchain_community.retrievers import SVMRetriever
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
API Reference:SVMRetriever | OpenAIEmbeddings
Create New Retriever with Texts
retriever = SVMRetriever.from_texts(
[""foo"", ""bar"", ""world"", ""hello"", ""foo bar""], OpenAIEmbeddings()
)
Use Retriever
We can now use the retriever!
result = retriever.invoke(""foo"")
result
[Document(page_content='foo', metadata={}),
Document(page_content='foo bar', metadata={}),
Document(page_content='hello', metadata={}),
Document(page_content='world', metadata={})]

Tavily's Search API is a search engine built specifically for AI agents (LLMs), delivering real-time, accurate, and factual results at speed.
We can use this as a retriever. It will show functionality specific to this integration. After going through, it may be useful to explore relevant use-case pages to learn how to use this vectorstore as part of a larger chain.
Integration details
Retriever | Source | Package |
---|---|---|
TavilySearchAPIRetriever | Internet search | langchain_community |
Setup
If you want to get automated tracing from individual queries, you can also set your LangSmith API key by uncommenting below:
# os.environ[""LANGSMITH_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""Enter your LangSmith API key: "")
# os.environ[""LANGSMITH_TRACING""] = ""true""
Installation
The integration lives in the langchain-community
package. We also need to install the tavily-python
package itself.
%pip install -qU langchain-community tavily-python
We also need to set our Tavily API key.
import getpass
import os
os.environ[""TAVILY_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass()
Instantiation
Now we can instantiate our retriever:
from langchain_community.retrievers import TavilySearchAPIRetriever
retriever = TavilySearchAPIRetriever(k=3)
Usage
query = ""what year was breath of the wild released?""
retriever.invoke(query)
