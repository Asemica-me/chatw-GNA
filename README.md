# AI-powered Chatbot for Geoportale Nazionale dell'Archeologia (GNA)

## 🌐 Overview

This repository contains the code for a **Question-Answering (QnA) application** designed to enhance user interaction and knowledge accessibility in the context of the [**Geoportale Nazionale dell'Archeologia (GNA)**](https://gna.cultura.gov.it/progetto.html) project. The application integrates **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to streamline user operations, ensuring precise and context-aware responses based on the platform’s [documentation](https://gna.cultura.gov.it/wiki/index.php/Pagina_principale).

The system is built using the **LangChain framework**, integrated with **Mistral AI** and **FAISS vector store**, and operates through a **Streamlit interface**.

## 🎯 Objectives

The chatbot aims to provide a conversational interface for users, helping them navigate the GNA user manual efficiently. Key functionalities include:

- **Contextual, accurate responses** generated by the chatbot using generative AI.
- **Italian language support**, with potential for multilingual capabilities.
- Seamless **retrieval of information** from the structured dataset.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application consists of the following components:
1. 📄 **Data Extraction**: Data is extracted from an XML sitemap and processed into a structured CSV dataset.
2. 🔠 **Vectorization**: Text chunks are converted into embeddings using **Mistral AI** and stored in **FAISS** for efficient querying.
3. 🔍 **Retrieval Mechanism**: User queries are matched against the stored embeddings to retrieve semantically similar text.
4. 💬 **Response Generation**: The **chosen LLM** - Mistral NeMo is suggested - generates context-aware responses based on the retrieved information.
5. 🧠 **Conversational Memory**: A memory buffer retains the context of the conversation, ensuring coherent interactions.

## ⭐ Key Features

- **Generative AI**: The chatbot generates responses based on context-aware retrieval.
- **Vector Store**: Efficient query retrieval using FAISS for storing text embeddings.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Custom user interface for easy interaction with the chatbot.
- **Multilingual Support**: Primarily in Italian with potential to expand.
